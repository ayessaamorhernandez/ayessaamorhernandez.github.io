<h1>HELLO, World!</h1>
<h3>Welcome to my page!</h3>

<b></b>
<p>How are you doing, buddy? First of all, thank you for visiting my page. If you want to know more about me, just read the next paragraph.</p>
<p>Hi! I'm Ayessa Amor N. Hernandez, but you can call me Ayessa :) I am currently taking a BS in Computer Science and so far, my "favorite" CMSC subject is, I think, CMSC 57 because I am really interested with logics and such, I am having fun learning it. I think my favorite GE would be WIKA 1 because I think I am more confident when I am speaking my native language.</p>
<p>Being able to learn different programming languages can really be so hard and overwhelming but the good part is that you are able to improve yourself and explore on what you really want to do.</p>
<p>As I was working here, I became hungry for some reasons hehe! Do you know what my favorite food is? Well, it's ICE CREAM! yumyum.</p>
<p>By the way, I just want you to know that I really like watching animes and Kdramas, and I am really into music that is why learning how to play musical instruments interests me. Just to add more about myself, I think I really don't have a fixed childhood dream hehe. Sometimes, I want to become an engineer, sometimes a nurse, sometimes a teacher, but most of the time I just want to play and enjoy life.</p>
<p>Thank you again for visiting!</p>
